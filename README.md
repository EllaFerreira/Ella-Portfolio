# Ella-Portfolio

I'm a firm believer in keeping things simple and I try to keep things as minimal as I can, but sometimes that slips away. 
I'm happy with my last update and I think learning is a journey where you should put yourself out of the confort zone.

# Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
